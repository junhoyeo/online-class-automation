# Online Class Automation

Due to COVID-19, all schools in South Korea are doing their classes online, which means **students has to find their own classrooms** before each class start.<br />
Since I desperately want to sleep during it, but don't want to be disturbed each time when a class end, I came up this script, which **automates joining ZOOM meetings** for online classes at the right time.<br />
Hope it's useful for people who enjoy sleep and music like me.
